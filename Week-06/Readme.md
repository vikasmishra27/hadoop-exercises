### Objectives 

* Learn to setup install and configure latest release of Sqoop 
* Learn to install and use the Mysql Connector/J platform 
* Configure and execute a Sqoop import command 
* Configure and run a combined Hadoop/Sqoop job  

### Outcomes 

At the conclusion of this lab you will have gained experience installing, configuring, and executing Sqoop on top of a Hadoop cluster.   You will understand the nature of Sqoopâ€™s connection to mysql as well as how to create a combined Hadoop/Sqoop job to execute importing and analysis in a single command. 

### Part I

Assuming the completion of week 05 homework and a working Sqoop instance and the running of the sample code from chapter 15 MaxWidgitID.java.  You are to use the same syntax to create a Sqoop application that will run the Sqoop import and the MapReduce code in a single class.  You will need to modify the sample code provided in the book.

1) If your last name is **A-K** the mode for temperature per your year 
1) If your last name **L-Z** the average temperature for the year 
1) Execute ```hadoop fs -cat <outputfile>```, place a screenshot of these results (using the year you were assigned) in deliverable 1.

### Part II 

Repeat the work above this time add a ```WHERE``` clause selecting only record number 1000-5000 and temperature between 2 and 20 Celcius. Execute ```hadoop fs -cat <outputfile>```, place the screenshot in delvierable 2.
