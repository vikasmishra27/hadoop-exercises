## Short summary and your conclusion
SUMMARY – 
Main purpose of the meet was to introduce us with the Chicago open data available regarding the complains registered in the area at COPA SODA API. This data is available at https://data.cityofchicago.org/resorce/ktn3-fjzw.json , this website has data of all the criminal cases registered over the years along with the complaint area and other attributes. The data file which was accessed from mentioned URL was used as input in SoQL(Salesforce Object Query language) Data portal https://vingkan.github.io/soql/ to execute some queries to analyze the data. Instructor gave a hands on this data accessed. We tried to get information like selecting total number of complaints over the area. We even tried to get the total complaint in different beat or area. We analyzed data by more by getting the date which had the maximum complaint counts and minimum complaint counts or which race has the maximum number of registered complaints against them.
 https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofchicago.org/ktn3-fjzw has the description of all the fields that the are present in the dataset. We were informed about the site https://dev.socrata.com/docs/functions/#2.1 where we can find all the list of functions or queries that can be used from SoQL portal. 
A summary of all steps that we did were –

Step 1 – Going to Chicago Civilian office of Police Accountability and access “Access City of Chicago Data Portal” under “Data and Cases”.

Step 2 – From cityofchicago.org we copy API endpoint data in JSON format

Step 3 – Open SoQL Data Portal

Step 4 – copy the file to SoQL potal

Step 5 – From socrata.com go to “COPA Cases - Summary” page we got to access all the fields and their description

Step 6 – Type different forms of query to analyze data like getting the total registered cases count, getting cases count for each area or which month has highest number of criminal cases registered.

## CONCLUSION –
The whole session was helpful in terms of getting to know about the open source information available also an introduction SoQL database portal, its datatypes and functions was a good information. I learned about the various kinds of analysis that can be performed on the data. It can also be used from various research purposes. As it was data about complains in various areas in Chicago, it can be helpful information interesting various fields like checking for areas where  crime has increased or decreased over the years or which areas has a higher crime rate or which race has maximum cases registered against them. I personally found it very interesting to know about this information and to understand all the ways that it can be used.
Your observations and comments about the subject.

## OBSERVATION/COMMENTS –
According to me the whole session was very informational and interesting. Getting exposure to all the data and new database SoQL data portal. The whole session was mostly about the COPA open sourse data and its platform Socrata. All the information was interesting but I felt that it would have been  better if more information was shared in terms of all the new platforms that we worked with, even though after the session I tried to understand more the new database and portal I came across. Like –

Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) is used to build queries for fetching data in the Force.com platform. Just as we write a query in Structured Query Language (SQL) with some columns and a table, here, in SOQL, we write a query with some fields and an object. However, SOQL does not support all the features of SQL.

COPA - The newly-formed Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA) published detailed complaint data on the City of Chicago Data Portal. The new datasets include the nature of the complaint, the time of the complaint, status and any findings as a result of the complaint, whether it was a police-involved shooting, and basic demographic information on the reported victims and officers.

As a result I would say that along with all the analysis that we did at the session there was so much I learned after the session as well.
